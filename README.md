# Learning React

This React application has two tabs. The first tab displays currency exchange rates of the Icelandic Krona and the second tab displays words of wisdom. On the first tab the data is fetched using the fetch method and on the second tab using axios. I used two different methods only to learn about them. The project uses state and effect hooks. The first tab has a button which refreshes the page and the second tab has a button which loads a new set of wise words.

I deployed the app first on Netlify but the fetch request on the firt tab did not work. I deployed the same code on Heroku and everything seems to be working now.
